# Hello Core Data

This is an intro talk given to the [Iowa Mobile Developers][iowamobiledevs] in March 2012. The talk covers the basic CRUD operations of Core Data, and touches on some of the strengths and weaknesses of Core Data.

The included HelloCoreData Xcode project is a trimmed version of the Core Data template project included in Xcode 4.2. The Detail view controller has been removed, and a simple _jibberish_ property has been added to the Event object.
